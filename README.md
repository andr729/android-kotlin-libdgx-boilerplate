### Android + Kotlin + libGDX

A boilerplace of Android (Kotlin) integration with libGDX.

At the point of creating this code, libGDX nighty build (1.9.8) fails when selecting Kotlin as the primary language.
Also the gradle scripts generated by libGDX use much older version of Gradle than Android Studio (v3.1.2) which may cause integration problems.

The example here solves that issues by extending a new project (blank Activity) generated for Kotlin by Android Studio with proper Gradle setup.

The whole process is also described at my blog:

### Demo

Some simple demo of text transition is added to verify the setup:
